# all-of-the-trails
This repo creates an interactive Strava activity tracker, which can be used [here](https://www.giraffesinaboat.com/)!  Use the tool to easily track your Strava activities. The poltting tool will show your progress towards using all of the trails in your region as well as track your travels. The tool is interactive and can further split/ plot your data by type, gear, and year.

I created this tool as a sandbox to work with the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) as well as learn how to host a website using Digital Ocean's [app platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/). Here is the result!

## How to create your own sandbox
I wanted to open source this code to aid others in their own projects. Also feel free to propose ideas here vs issues or even prs. This code is a work and progress and I'm slowly implamenting new features. But first, here are the basic steps to replicate the tool to play on your own:

### The basic steps:
1) Fork this repo
2) Create your own Strava App
3) Buy a domain name and set it up
4) Create a digital ocean account
5) Create a new app and link everything up!
6) See if it worked
